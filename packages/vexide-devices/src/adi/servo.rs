//! ADI Servo
//!
//! This module provides an interface for controlling the legacy 3-Wire Servo.
//!
//! # Hardware Overview
//!
//! Servos are similar in both appearance and function to [`AdiMotor`]s, with the
//! caveat that they are designed to hold a specific *angle* rather than a continious
//! *speed*. In other words:
//!
//! - Motors are designed for continuous rotation, providing variable speed and
//!   direction of rotation.
//! - Servos are designed for precise angular positioning, typically rotating to and
//!   holding a specific angle within a limited range of motion.
//!
//! Servos, similar to motors, are PWM controlled. They use a standard
//! [servo control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servo_control) singal. A PWM input of
//! 1ms - 2ms will give full reverse to full forward, while 1.5ms is neutral.
//!
//! # Operating Range
//!
//! The VEX legacy servo has an operating range of 100 degrees:
//! - Minimum: -50 degrees (represented by [`AdiServo::MIN_POSITION`])
//! - Maximum: 50 degrees (represented by [`AdiServo::MAX_POSITION`])
//!
//! Its neutral state is at 0째 rotation (the middle of its operating range).
